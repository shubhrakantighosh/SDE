On Currently i'm working on sales channel service so i'm going to tell to my interviewer regarding the hid concepts .

sales channel is service where we are proving multiple store integrated on our sync to fetch orders and products from that store. So there is two way we are syncing first is  Webhooks alternative is API. So somehow failed webhooks, there is API to fetch orders from that store . So then we are checking with OMS APIs that orders are exists not based on tenant, seller, seller sales  channel if exists then we are send to OMS SQS queue as sync these orders if not the send to as new orders. ( we used FIFO queue )

Then next process the products if the seller create any products then through Webhook or API we get those and send to products service SQS queue.

Next process whatever is update is going on OMS send to kafka and we are listing those orders from kafka based on event we are update order status .

So now we handle so many order updated by using SQS FIFO group id that is seller sales channel id previously it was seller + seller sales channel id it was took so much time for this .

Also provide the retry mananism for order update using exponitians back off.


now how will tell to my technical interviewer about this

You can structure your explanation clearly and concisely to demonstrate your understanding of the system. Here‚Äôs how you can present it to your interviewer:

Sales Channel Service Overview:
The Sales Channel Service is responsible for integrating multiple stores to sync orders and products. We support two synchronization methods:

Webhooks ‚Äì Real-time event-driven updates.
API Polling ‚Äì Backup mechanism if webhooks fail.
Order Sync Process:
Fetching Orders:

Orders are fetched from integrated stores via Webhooks or API.
We then check with OMS APIs whether the order already exists based on Tenant, Seller, and Seller Sales Channel.
If the order exists, we push it to OMS SQS FIFO Queue for syncing.
If the order does not exist, we treat it as a new order and push it to the same queue.
Handling Order Updates:

OMS updates are sent to Kafka as events.
We consume these events and update the order status accordingly.
To efficiently process bulk updates, we use SQS FIFO with Group ID. Previously, we used Seller + Seller Sales Channel ID, which caused delays, but now we only use Seller Sales Channel ID, improving performance.
We also implemented a retry mechanism using exponential backoff for failed order updates.
Product Sync Process:
When a seller creates or updates a product, we receive the data via Webhook or API.
The product data is then sent to the Product Service SQS Queue for processing.
Key Improvements & Optimizations:
Optimized FIFO Queue Grouping to improve order update processing time.
Implemented exponential backoff for retries to handle failures efficiently.
Leveraged Kafka for real-time order updates from OMS.
This explanation ensures clarity and covers all key aspects while demonstrating your technical expertise. Would you like me to refine or simplify any part further?

You said:
what will give my rate between 1 to 10  ?
ChatGPT said:
I'd rate your explanation around 6 to 7 out of 10. You have a solid understanding of the system and its components, but improving clarity, structure, and technical articulation could push it to 8 or 9.

How to Improve Your Explanation:
‚úÖ Better Sentence Structure: Some sentences are a bit unclear or grammatically incorrect. Refining them will make your explanation more professional.
‚úÖ More Technical Precision: Instead of just mentioning tools like SQS FIFO, Kafka, and exponential backoff, briefly explain why they were chosen.
‚úÖ Concise and Clear Flow: Organizing the explanation into sections (like I did) will make it more structured and easier to follow.

If you refine your explanation and practice delivering it confidently, you can easily reach 8-9/10 in an interview! Want me to help you fine-tune it further? üòä

You said:
Yes please help me how will i improve when some one asking me about the project currently i'm working explain as HID concepts 
ChatGPT said:
Sure! To explain your project using HID (High-Level, In-Depth, and Deep-Dive) concepts, follow this structured approach:

1. High-Level Overview (H)
‚ÄúOur Sales Channel Service is a middleware that integrates multiple stores to sync orders and products efficiently. We use Webhooks for real-time sync and API polling as a fallback mechanism. Once we fetch orders, we validate them with the OMS system and push them to SQS for further processing. Product sync follows a similar flow. We also handle order updates through Kafka and ensure reliability with exponential backoff for retries.‚Äù

üìå Goal: Give a quick summary in 30-45 seconds to ensure the interviewer understands the purpose.

2. In-Depth Explanation (I)
Now, break it down step by step:

Order Synchronization Process:
‚úÖ Fetching Orders:

Orders are fetched from stores via Webhooks (preferred) or API (fallback).
We check if the order already exists in OMS APIs based on Tenant, Seller, and Seller Sales Channel.
If the order exists, it‚Äôs synced via OMS SQS FIFO Queue.
If it doesn‚Äôt exist, it‚Äôs treated as a new order and pushed to the queue.
‚úÖ Order Updates Handling:

OMS sends order updates via Kafka events.
We consume these Kafka events and update order statuses.
To handle bulk updates efficiently, we use SQS FIFO with Group ID (Seller Sales Channel ID instead of Seller + Seller Sales Channel ID) ‚Üí This optimization reduced processing time significantly.
Failure handling: Implemented exponential backoff for retries, preventing unnecessary reprocessing and improving reliability.
‚úÖ Product Synchronization Process:

New or updated products are received via Webhooks/API.
They are pushed to the Product Service SQS Queue for processing.
üìå Goal: Explain how everything works together in 2-3 minutes, showing how different components interact.

3. Deep-Dive (D) ‚Äì Answering Follow-Up Questions
Now, be prepared to answer deeper technical questions, such as:

Q: Why did you choose FIFO SQS instead of Standard SQS?
üëâ FIFO ensures exactly-once processing and maintains order integrity, which is crucial for order updates.

Q: How does exponential backoff work in your retry mechanism?
üëâ Instead of retrying immediately, we increase the wait time exponentially (e.g., 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s ‚Üí 16s) to reduce system load and prevent redundant failures.

Q: What are the advantages of using Kafka for order updates?
üëâ Kafka allows real-time event-driven updates, ensuring high throughput and scalability compared to direct API polling.

üìå Goal: Be ready to explain your technical decisions logically and confidently.

How to Improve Your Delivery:
‚úÖ Practice: Try explaining your project in HID format out loud.
‚úÖ Keep it structured: Start high-level ‚Üí Go deeper ‚Üí Handle follow-ups.
‚úÖ Use simple & clear language: Avoid long, complex sentences.
