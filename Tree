Level-order (Breadth-First)
This method prints the tree level by level, starting from the root. A queue data structure is typically used.
Enqueue the root node.
While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a node and print its value.
Enqueue its left child (if it exists).
Enqueue its right child (if it exists).
Depth-first (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order)
These methods traverse the tree down to the leaf nodes before exploring siblings.
Pre-order:
(Root, Left, Right)
Print the value of the current node.
Recursively traverse the left subtree.
Recursively traverse the right subtree.
In-order:
(Left, Root, Right) - Often used for Binary Search Trees to print values in sorted order.
Recursively traverse the left subtree.
Print the value of the current node.
Recursively traverse the right subtree.
Post-order:
(Left, Right, Root)
Recursively traverse the left subtree.
Recursively traverse the right subtree.
Print the value of the current node
